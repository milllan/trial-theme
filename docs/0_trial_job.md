Assessment Brief: WordPress Developer Position
Project Overview

As part of your application for the WordPress Developer position, you are required to develop a fully functional WordPress website based on a provided Figma template. This project will test your ability to translate design concepts into a responsive, user-friendly WordPress site while demonstrating your technical proficiency in front-end and back-end development.

Figma Template Overview

The template you are required to base your website on can be accessed via the following link:
https://www.figma.com/community/file/1314076616839640516

This Figma design provides a visual framework for the following key pages and features:

    Homepage: Layout with a hero section, navigation menu, call-to-action buttons, and footer.

    About Page: Section for company information, team members, and values.

    Services Page: Description of services with corresponding icons or images.

    Blog Page: A simple layout with a list of blog posts.

    Contact Page: Contact form, location map, and contact information.

    Responsive Design: The website must be fully responsive across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).


Objectives

You are expected to:

    Convert the Figma design into a WordPress website, maintaining as much fidelity to the design as possible.

    Ensure a fully responsive layout that works on multiple devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

    Implement basic functionality, including navigation, forms, and interactive elements (such as buttons, hover effects, etc.).
    Use best practices for WordPress development:

        Create a custom WordPress theme.

        Properly implement reusable components (header, footer, sidebar).

        Use Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) or similar tools for flexible content management.

        Ensure accessibility standards are met.

        Optimize for performance (e.g., loading times, image sizes, scripts).

        Provide a clean and well-documented codebase.


Requirements
1. WordPress Theme Development

    Develop the website as a custom WordPress theme using HTML, CSS, and PHP.

    Implement WordPress-specific functionality, such as the WordPress Loop for blog posts.

    Ensure the theme is compatible with the latest WordPress version.

2. Content Management

    Use Custom Post Types and Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) (if necessary) to provide an easy-to-manage interface for the client to update content such as text, images, and links.

    Provide a simple, intuitive dashboard for updating pages, blog posts, team members, services, and other key content areas.

3. Responsiveness

    Ensure the site is fully responsive and optimized for both mobile and desktop devices.

    Use CSS media queries to adjust layout, typography, and images for various screen sizes.

4. Plugin Integration (Optional)

    Implement any necessary plugins to ensure the functionality of the contact form, blog posts, and other features as outlined in the template.

    If using plugins, make sure they are secure, up-to-date, and do not affect site performance.

5. User Experience (UX)

    Follow best practices for UX/UI design by ensuring the navigation is intuitive, forms are easy to use, and content is presented in a clear, engaging manner.

    Pay attention to typography, color schemes, and visual hierarchy in line with the Figma design.

6. SEO & Performance

    Ensure the website is optimized for search engines (SEO). Implement basic SEO strategies (e.g., meta tags, title tags, alt attributes for images).

    Optimize the website for fast loading times (minify CSS/JS, image optimization, lazy loading, etc.).

7. Testing

    Conduct thorough testing across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

    Ensure all links, forms, and interactive elements function correctly.

    Ensure all design elements are pixel-perfect and consistent with the Figma file.


Deliverables

    WordPress Website: A fully functional WordPress website based on the Figma design, hosted on your development environment or a live demo URL.

    Codebase: Provide the source code for the custom WordPress theme, including all PHP, CSS, and JavaScript files, as well as the functions.php file.

    Documentation: A brief document (1-2 pages) explaining your development process, the choices you made regarding theme development, and any plugins or tools you used.

    Demo URL: A live demo URL showcasing the website. If not hosted publicly, provide a local development setup with instructions for running the site.


Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be assessed based on the following criteria:

    Design Fidelity: How closely the developed website matches the Figma design, including layout, typography, and styling.

    Functionality: The quality of the website’s functionality, including responsiveness, navigation, forms, and interactive features.

    Code Quality: The cleanliness, readability, and organization of the code. Proper use of WordPress best practices, including code documentation and comments.

    Performance and SEO: How well the website performs (e.g., load times, optimizations) and whether basic SEO best practices are followed.

    User Experience (UX): The overall user experience, including ease of navigation, accessibility, and mobile responsiveness.

    Creativity: The ability to go beyond the Figma design by adding small enhancements or creative improvements that improve the site’s usability or aesthetics.


Timeline

    Time Limit: 4 hours.
    *This is a stress test—it's unlikely you'll complete the full website in 4 hours. We want to see the progress you've made and how you handle quality within a limited time frame.

    If you don't submit your trial task in the next 3 days, we will assume you are not interested in this role anymore and consider this trial as failed.


Submission Instructions

    Upload your theme files (including images, CSS, and JavaScript) to a GitHub repository or a similar version control platform.

    Include a link to a live demo of your website, or provide a zip file (you may upload the zip file on Google Drive and provide the link) with a WordPress installation package and detailed instructions on how to run the site locally.
