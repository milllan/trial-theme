**Figma JSON Structure Observatio:**

- Step 1: Complete Your Design Tokens (CSS Variables)
Your JSON is full of reusable values for colors, fonts, and spacing. We need to extract these and put them in the :root of your CSS file. This is the foundation of a maintainable stylesheet.

    Colors: fills, strokes in the JSON give us RGBA values. We convert these to hex or CSS rgb()/rgba(). For example, the dark background (r:0.079...) becomes rgb(20, 20, 20).
    Fonts: fontFamily: "Urbanist" becomes var(--font-family-main). Font weights like 500 and 600 become variables.
    Spacing & Radii: itemSpacing, paddingLeft, cornerRadius from the JSON become your spacing and border-radius variables.

- Step 2: Apply Layout and Box Model Properties
This is where you translate Figma's Auto Layout into CSS Flexbox or Grid.

    layoutMode: "VERTICAL" becomes display: flex; flex-direction: column;.
    layoutMode: "HORIZONTAL" becomes display: flex; flex-direction: row;.
    primaryAxisAlignItems: "SPACE_BETWEEN" becomes justify-content: space-between;.
    counterAxisAlignItems: "CENTER" becomes align-items: center;.
    paddingLeft, paddingTop, etc. directly map to CSS padding.
    itemSpacing maps to the gap property in Flexbox/Grid.

A Crucial Note: Do NOT use absoluteBoundingBox for layout. The x and y coordinates are for absolute positioning only. Your use of containers and a component-based structure is the correct, modern approach. Rely on Flexbox, Grid, and margins for positioning.

- Step 3: Style the Details (Typography, Color, Borders)
This is the final polish where you apply the design tokens.

    Text: For a node with type: "TEXT", apply the font-size, font-weight, and color from your variables.
    Containers/Cards: Apply background-color, border, and border-radius using your variables.
    Effects: A DROP_SHADOW effect in the JSON translates directly to the box-shadow CSS property.
